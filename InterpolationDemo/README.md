## InterpolationDemo
----------------------------------
This app is an example of interpolation.

==================================

**Details:**
- The app has two spinners.
	- The first one has a list of a bunch of different interpolators like _accelerate_, _decelerate_, _bounce_, _decelerate_, _linear_, _overshoot_.
	- And the second spinner has different timings, from 100 milliseconds all the way up to 3,000 milliseconds or three seconds, _so that you can see how fast or how slow things work_.

**In Code:**
- Create a new instance of the interpolator.
	- Because it's different based off of what the name is, we actually use the Java **`Class.forName(String className)`** to get the class and then instantiate a new instance.
	- But if you were using this in your own app, you would call, **`new BounceInterpolator()`** directly.
- Call **`animate`** on our text view and:
	- set the interpolator: **`setInterpolator(Interpolator i)`** - _Sets the acceleration curve for this animation._, and
	- set the duration from our spinner: **`setDuration(long durationMillis)`** - _How long this animation should last._, and
	- tell it to start in 500 milliseconds: **`setStartDelay(long startDelay)`** - _The amount of time, in milliseconds, to delay processing the animation after start() is called._ and
	- move the animation from the bottom of the screen: **`translationYBy(float value)`** - _This method will cause the View's translationY property to be animated by the specified value._, and then
	- start the animation: **`start()`**.
