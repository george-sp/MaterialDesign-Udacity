## TypographicalDemo
----------------------------------
A small app to show you the different typographical sizes, and their names, that are available in Android.

> Let's say you found a font that looks great on a bunch of different screen resolutions and different sizes, and even better, it doesn't detract from the overall theme of your app.
> How would you use it?
