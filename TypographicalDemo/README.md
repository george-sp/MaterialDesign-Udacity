## TypographicalDemo
----------------------------------
A small app to show you the different typographical sizes, and their names, that are available in Android.

> Let's say you found a font that looks great on a bunch of different screen resolutions and different sizes, and even better, it doesn't detract from the overall theme of your app.
>
> How would you use it?
>
> 1. Pick up a font from Google web fonts, because most of them are available with open source licenses.
> 2. Add an `assets` directory under `source` `main`.
> 3. Include the selected font, which in this case is "Courgette-Regular", in the `assets` directory.
